# ML-with-TensorFlow
This repo contains a series of jupyter notebooks on ML with TensorFlow (TF), where we elaborate on the undocumented details! Although I found TF amazing, but the documentation is rather weak and usually ayou are left with many question, like:
- Which implementation/API shall I use?
- Why certain approach are preffered over others?

In these series of notebook I try to provide an in depth explanation, with the hope that could possibly help others.
